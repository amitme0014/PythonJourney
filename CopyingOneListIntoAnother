#This code shows copying one list into another
list1=[1,2,3,4,]
list2=[]
list2=list1
print(list1,"list1 values")
print(list2,"list2 values after copying list1 into list2") 
#But above code has one bug, when we will try to append some value into any of the list , the other one will reflect the same changes, as they are referencing to same address
#Lets check this by appending a value into any of the list and then printing both the list
list1.append("5")
print(list1,"printing the values of list1, after apppending 5")
print(list2,"list2 also prints 5")
#To overcome this problem, we use copy method 
list3=[]
list3=list2.copy()
print(list3,"printing list3 before appending a value in list2")
list2.append('9')
print(list2,"Appending 9 into list2")
print(list3,"9 would not have been appended in list2")
